            <p>A cozy gaming bar filled with passionate game developers showing their creations.
These are the essential words to describe the <em>Bonus Stage</em> event.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Sunday 15 April, the last day of the London Games Week.<br />
I take the bus, heading to Dalston where the Loading bar is full of shiny games to try.
I&rsquo;m just arrived and, after opening the door, I discover a real paradise.</p>

<div class="text-center my-4">
    <figure class="figure my-0">
        
        <img src="./imgs/arcade.jpg" 
            alt="Oooh the Konami logo, so many memories"
            class=" figure-img img-fluid rounded" />
        
        

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            

            
            <p>
                Oooh the Konami logo, so many memories
                
                
                
            </p>

    </figure>
</div>



<p>The first thing that I notice is an old Konami arcade. Near the joysticks there is
a little board with the rules for the event: one vote per person,
the winning game takes the &ldquo;Diamond Geezer&rdquo; trophy.</p>

<p>I grab a beer and then I go for a quick tour of the first floor: I start talking with a couple
of Italian guys.<br />
One of them is Luciano, an indie developer who is working on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swordsofcalengal/">Swords of Calengal</a>. This game is currently in development and it&rsquo;s really
promising: last year it won the technical production award at Svilupparty (an Italian videogame developers event).
Unfortunately the game is not part of Bonus Stage line-up and I cannot try it today.</p>

<p>The other Italian guy is Enrico, the sound designer of Ruya:</p>

</div>

<br></p>

<p>Developed by <em>Miracle Tea Studios</em>, <a href="http://www.ruyagame.com/">Ruya</a> is a very a cool (in every sense)
puzzle game for Android and iOS.</p>

<p>I really like the aesthetics and the concept of the game. It&rsquo;s not just a
game about matching pieces together, it&rsquo;s an intense experience: just
watch the first minute of the video, I was completely mesmerized.
Enrico, you did a great job with music and sound effects! I&rsquo;m really astonished!</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for me to try some other video games; every game station
is occupied at the moment, but downstairs there are more game ready to be played:
<em>Black Friday</em> and <em>Disobedient Sheep</em>.</p>

<h2 id="black-friday">Black Friday</h2>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TS_7yDEi2J8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p><br>
<a href="https://www.blackfridaysim.com/">Black Friday</a> is a very peculiar &ldquo;shopping simulator&rdquo; game, developed by Chel.</p>

<p>The game starts in a shopping mall corridor: you hit the fire alarm and then
you enter in the actual shop, ready to smash every item that cross your road!
You have a limited amount of time, so you need to hurry and choose your path carefully,
aiming for the most expensive items.<br />
The design is straightforward, but the gameplay is surely a ton of insane fun. It can hardly
be explained by my words, you should really try it!<br />
Unfortunately there is no playable demo available at the moment, but keep tuned,
you will probably be able to have it soon, on Linux and OSX as well!</p>

<hr />

<p>Okay, after some &ldquo;alternative shopping&rdquo;, I move to the table nearby where
I try the next game.</p>

<h2 id="disobedient-sheep">Disobedient Sheep</h2>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FGn1AQQKB28" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p><br></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DisobSheepGame">Disobedient Sheep</a> is a local coop game, developed by Laurie.
In this game you control a cute dog who needs to save sheeps from dangerous
items falling from the sky!</p>

<p>I sit, ready to play a game with a really friendly girl, but wait&hellip;
where is the second controller? Isn&rsquo;t this supposed to be a multiplayer game?</p>

<p>Laurie, noting my wonder, clarifies that the game is meant to be played with a single
controller: I will use the left analog stick, she will use the right stick.
So, after selecting our favourite dogs, we start running through sheeps:
from the beginning, it&rsquo;s clear that you need coordination with your friend.</p>

<p>Well done Laurie, I really enjoyed the gameplay! The main mechanic communicates
a really important message: to overcome the challenges it&rsquo;s important to understand
the game, as well as it is to understand your partner.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now I just finished my beer, and it&rsquo;s time to go upstairs and refill.<br />
While heading to the bar, a free PC station capture my attention!</p>

<h2 id="elemental-flow">Elemental Flow</h2>


<div class="text-center my-4">
    <figure class="figure my-0">
        
        <img src="./imgs/elemental-flow.png" 
            alt="Elemental Flow"
            class=" figure-img img-fluid rounded" />
        
        

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            

            
            <p>
                Elemental Flow
                
                
                
            </p> 
        </figcaption>
        
    </figure>
</div>



<p><br></p>

<p><em>Elemental Flow</em> is a single player game about <em>&ldquo;understanding other people&rdquo;</em> and handling discussions.
The gamplay is really difficult to explain in simple words,
it&rsquo;s actually easier to try the game by going to <a href="https://teapoweredgames.itch.io/elemental-flow-sofia">Tea Powered&rsquo;s Itch.io page</a> (unfortunately, there is no Linux release at the moment). For who enjoys my bad English, feel free to keep reading.</p>

<p>You are in control of a female character, inside a bar.
The music and the art style set a dreamlike mood.</p>

<p>The main gameplay starts when you start talking with other people:
you have a limited amount of time, to sort the discussion in a good way.
To do this, you have to preserve &ldquo;health points&rdquo; of both speakers.<br />
In a discussion it&rsquo;s important to recognize when to listen and when to speak:
if the other person is complaining, it&rsquo;s a better to just listen.
If you decide to shout and talk over him, then both characters will probably loose energy.</p>

<p>Playing this game, various thoughts start rambling inside my mind:
am I too harsh sometines? Do I hurt others with my words?<br />
<em>Elemental Flow</em> is a really introspective game. I personally like this kind of
adventures, keep it going TeaPoweredGames!</p>

<hr />

<p>Now it&rsquo;s almost time to vote, but I still didn&rsquo;t try all the games. Damn, I don&rsquo;t
have enough time, I pick the pen and express my preference (top secret information :P).<br />
Nonetheless, I want to try other games as well, so I take a quick look around and I notice
a really colorful game: let&rsquo;s go!</p>

<h2 id="detective-case-and-clown-bot">Detective Case and Clown Bot</h2>

</div>



<p>As soon as I come close to the gaming station, Diogo, one of the creators of
<a href="https://twitter.com/caseandbot">Case and Bot</a>, asks me if I want a pitch for the game: sure!</p>

<p>He energetically starts describing the game as a point and click adventure setted in
the Portugal of the &lsquo;80s.<br />
The game is hilarious, and the presentation is awesome: the characters seem really well
written. You start laughing right after the very first dialogue!</p>

<p>Wow Diogo, your pitch was awesome, now I&rsquo;m sincerely eager to explore this game
(yes, even if I&rsquo;m not a fan of this genre)!</p>

<hr />

<p>Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have much time to play the game, because the speaker
has just announced the final part of the event.</p>

<h2 id="announcing-the-winner">Announcing the winner</h2>

<p>People are gathering around the speaker. Drumrolls during the announcement:
the winner of the Bonus Stage event is&hellip; <strong>Black Friday</strong>!</p>

<p>Fast paced gameplay, familiar setting and a bit of crazy humor: a mix of elements that
most of the people seem to have enjoyed!
Congratulations Chel!</p>

<p>But congratulations also to every other developer, I personally enjoyed every
single game that I tried. They all looked unique and
worth playing.</p>

<p>Keep creating and sharing your games, there are a lot of people who will be really happy for your work,
and I will be the first one.</p>
