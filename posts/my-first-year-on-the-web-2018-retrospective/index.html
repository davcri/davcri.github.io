of retrospective to summarize what went good and what went bad in my 2018 and
what I plan for the future.</p><p>I still have to get used to blog writing, this post will be
confusonary, you have been warned.</p><h2 id=how-it-started-the-vision>How it started - The vision</h2><p>At the beginning of 2018 I opened this blog, withouth really knowing what to
write in it.
I just wanted a personal place on the web to put some info (email, Twitter,
Github/Gitlab profiles) where to talk about what I did during my time at
University.</p><p>I did it primarly because I was searching for a job and, without experience, I
could only show my personal projects, so I used this website as a &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo;.</p><p>But then time passed and I wanted something different from it: I wanted a
place where other people could find me and know me better.</p><p>Today I look at this website and I honestly don&rsquo;t like it, I don&rsquo;t feel like
it&rsquo;s representative of my personality. I&rsquo;ll probably reorganize the content and
the style in the next year and I&rsquo;ll write more about myself.
This website is terribly anonymous at the moment and I want to improve it.</p><p>After my first year I can say that I have a better idea of the direction that
I want to take with it.</p><hr><ul><li>I moved to London to work as a Full Stack Web Developer for a growing
startup</li><li>I worked for 10 months, it was a really exciting experience, I learned lots
of things about unit testing, e2e testing, Typescript, Angular4/5/6, Docker,
Fluent</li><li>Dino Path</li></ul><hr><h3 id=january-searching-a-job>January - Searching a job</h3><p>January: I started searching for jobs, I wanted to work abroad (I don&rsquo;t feel
like working in Italy, unfortunately) so I searched for jobs in UK and Germany.</p><h3 id=february-i-found-a-job-moving-to-uk>February - I found a job + moving to UK</h3><p>February: I found a job as a fullstack web developer with a growing startup, so
I moved there.</p><p>It was my first job and my first experience with a foreign
country (apart from occasional trips). I was excited and worried at the same
time, and <strong>this stressing situation gave me a lot of energies</strong>, probably it&rsquo;s
human nature: your body release more energy if you are under pressure.</p><h3 id=march-my-first-month-as-a-software-developer>March - My first month as a software developer</h3><p>Working with an agile team was a new thing for me: I was only used to
collaborate with others with Github/Gitlab issue tracking system and with the
common communication systems used by open source projects (IRC, Gitter, &hellip;).</p><p>The team with which I worked used an Agile/Scrum environment. I remember exactly
being really shy during the first days: I was scared of doing a stand-up daily
scrum, I was worried about my spoken English.</p><h3 id=april-new-friends-egx-rezzed>April - New friends + EGX Rezzed</h3><p>During this time I found an Italian online community of game developers,
Gameloop.it.</p><p>Many of them were already living in London and they were
attending the EGX Rezzed so we met in person at this nice event. It was really
nice to see a gaming industry event in UK: I never saw something similar in
Italy. Videogames are taken seriously in UK and this event is pretty
representative. Big spaces, excellent organization, lots of videogames,
developers and talks.</p><p>But I was really glad to meet some member of Gameloop: Matteo (aka Corrado),
Antonio, Rudi. They told me about a nice videogames event in Italy, called
Svilupparty and since I&rsquo;m all about videogames, I decided to book a flight
to go there in the next month.</p><h3 id=may-gameloop-svilupparty-and-harvard-cs50-gamedev-course>May - Gameloop, Svilupparty and Harvard CS50 gamedev course</h3><p>I flied back to Italy, in Bologna, where I attended the <strong>Svilupparty</strong>
together with my friend Pasquale Salvati. In Bologna we met other
Gameloop community members, I met personally Gianluca (aka theGiallo), Angelo
(aka Encelo), Manuele (aka ManHunter), Giulio and many others
(I&rsquo;m probably missing someone in this list).</p><p>It was really nice knowing each other, talking about videogames and drinking at
the &ldquo;baretto&rdquo; in the beautiful Bologna. I&rsquo;m looking forward to going back in
2019.</p><p>Rudi told me about Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 gamedev course, an online free course about
game programming with Lua, Love2D and Unity3D. I already wanted to dive into
game development as a side project, so it was a perfect coincidence.</p><p>I decided to take this course and also coordinate a group of other fellow
Gameloop members that wanted to take this course. I organized deadlines, I
made <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/283930553>some live coding on Twitch</a>,
and curated a <a href=https://forum.gameloop.it/d/449-gameloop50-seguiamo-il-cs50-insieme-impariamo-a-sviluppare-videogiochi>thread on the Gameloop forum</a>.</p><p>Now (December 2018) we just finished the course and we published our assignments
(with all the source code) on this Github repository: <a href=https://github.com/GameLoop-it/cs50_course_materials>https://github.com/GameLoop-it/cs50_course_materials</a></p><h3 id=june-crystal-bit-project>June - <strong>Crystal Bit</strong> project</h3><p><strong>Crystal Bit</strong> is a project (for Italian-speaking audience) that I started to
keep doing the things that I loved doing during
University: talking about game development, game design and open source software.</p><p>When I started this project I had a schedule in mind: release a new video every
2 weeks. It was not easy because I had a full time job and I didn&rsquo;t have experience with video-making.
YouTube, video editing, tutorials, etc. I didn&rsquo;t have any experience at all.</p><p>In 7 months I created 13 video tutorials for the Godot Game Engine (v3.0)
with 200 subscribers and 30&rsquo;000 minutes watched.</p><p>They are not impressive numbers, but I&rsquo;m really proud of what I achieved.
Especially considering that I didn&rsquo;t feel suited at all when I started; I was
actually scared of receiving negative feedback and instead all the comments and
the people that got in touch with me were super friendly! Thanks everyone!</p><p>I&rsquo;ll write more about Crystal Bit in the next weeks, I&rsquo;m planning about opening a
dedicated website, so that I can have Italian content on it and keep this blog
in English and open for a wider audience.</p><h3 id=july-august-september-working-hard>July, August, September - Working hard</h3><p>During these months I had a pretty busy schedule: deadline with my full-time
job, creating videos for Crystal Bit YT channel and keep studying gamedev with
the CS50 Harvard&rsquo;s course.</p><p><strong>Having little free time forces you to prioritize and optimize your time</strong>:
something that we should do always, but it&rsquo;s not easy to enforce because humans
are inherently lazy.</p><h3 id=october-quitting-my-first-job>October - Quitting my first job</h3><h3 id=november-coming-back-to-italy>November - Coming back to Italy</h3><h3 id=december-devember-and-implementing-triple-triad-with-godot>December - Devember and implementing Triple Triad with Godot</h3><h2 id=what-went-well-in-2018>What went well (in 2018)</h2><p>Actually 2018 was a really good year.</p><ul><li>terribly improved my English</li><li>had my first full time job as a software developer</li><li>improved my confidence</li><li>started loving taken flights and trains</li><li>started a YouTube channel</li><li>managed to keep my publish schedule (2 videos per month) while working fulltime

Decisions are not easy to take, but sometimes taking a leap can be a life
changing decision.</p><p>On January I was really depressed and unmotivated, even if I was living with
my family, in a lovely Italian village sorrounded by the mountains and I was
just doing what I loved: playing guitar, contributing to open source projects
(FreeCodeCamp, GDQuest,&hellip;), building my portfolio.</p><p>I packed the most essential things in a small bag and I left that
wonderful place, in search for a job and a new place.</p></div><div class=share><h4>Share</h4><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fdavcri.github.io%2fposts%2fmy-first-year-on-the-web-2018-retrospective%2f">Share on Twitter</a></div></div></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")
